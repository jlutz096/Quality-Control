# Quality Control in Manufacturing (QCiM)
Main repository for CS440 project "Image Quality Control in Manufacturing"

The main idea behind the conception of this project is to introduce more efficient ways in which Quality Control can be used in a manufacturing setting. The proposed idea is if we can create a system that can allow for faster processing of products in a manufacturing setting, then the more efficient the product can be made and delivered to the customer. 


<h2>Abstract</h2>

  The main idea behind this project is automating the quality control process in a manufacturing environment. The title of the project is Quality Control in Manufacturing (QCiM). The goal QCiM is to accomplish quality control of various products produced in manufacturing. The software runs off a camera feed that objectively 'grades' product as it passed under the video feed. After capture a percentage is returned and the system makes a judgement based upon the result. If passing, the product is allowed to continue down the production line, otherwise it is sent for refurbishment or to be destroyed.
  This product integrates a Computer Vision framework known as OpenCV. This project will be developed in Python, in an Jupyter Notebook environment. More information will be available in following sections.


<h2>Intro</h2>

Quality Control in Manufacturing (QCiM) is an software application that takes in images from a theoretical production line. Once it has an image, it compares it against a template image. A result is returned. Grading critera differs from product to product but the overall goal is Quality Control.
