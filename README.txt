Different iterations of the software as it progressed through the stages of development. 
-Full QCIM.py introduced the user interface with all buttons operational. 

-test2.py is the second to last iteration. It saw the selection button and code removed for simplicity. It closely resembles the final product. 
 Including the reference frame to the best possible match.
 
-test40.py is the last iteration. It introduces a new method in displaying the template image in grey scale with edge detection. 
 This is what will be used in finished product. 
 
-PyWindowQCiM.py is the code for creating the user interface. It was later incorporated into a iteration. Uploaded for development purposes.

-QCiM.py was the first version that introduced the user interface and code combination. The only buttons that work are 'select file' and 'Exit.'

-QCiMS.py was the first iteration of the driver code for the project. Displays all data relating to the template match functionality. 

-QualityControl.py was a testing ground for which method would be best suited for development. Left as a legacy code of sorts.
